        "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It is useful when the dataset contains outliers that may affect the performance of other metrics. A lower MAE value indicates better performance.\n",

        "Mean Squared Error (MSE): This metric measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors. A lower MSE value indicates better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This metric is similar to MSE but takes the square root of the MSE to make the units of the error metric the same as the target variable. It is useful when the target variable has a specific unit, such as dollars for house prices. A lower RMSE value indicates better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "R-squared (R2): This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. R2 can be useful for comparing the performance of different models.\n",

        "The choice of the best metric depends on factors such as the nature of your dataset, the importance of outliers, and the practical implications of different types of errors. In real-world applications, it's often a good practice to consider multiple metrics and potentially perform sensitivity analysis to ensure your model aligns with your goals and requirements."

        "MSE directly measures the average squared difference between your predicted house prices and the actual house prices in the dataset. This metric places more significant emphasis on larger errors, which means that it penalizes predictions that are further away from the actual prices more severely. In the context of predicting house prices, accuracy in terms of minimizing the magnitude of errors is essential because you want your predictions to be as close to the actual prices as possible.\n",

A high R2 doesn't necessarily mean that your model's predictions are close to the actual prices.\n",

        "Reasons why MAE is a good choice in this scenario:\n",
        "\n",
        "Robustness to Outliers: MAE is less sensitive to extreme values (outliers) compared to Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). In MSE and RMSE, squaring the errors can disproportionately magnify the impact of outliers on the overall error, making them less suitable for datasets with significant outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretability: MAE provides a straightforward and interpretable measure of prediction error. It represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values in the same units as the target variable. This makes it easier to understand the typical magnitude of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outlier Resistance: Since MAE treats all errors equally in terms of weight, it doesn't excessively penalize models for making large errors on outliers. This can be beneficial if outliers in your dataset represent important but infrequent cases that you don't want the model to overly discount.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's still important to handle outliers appropriately in your modeling process. You might consider preprocessing techniques like outlier detection and removal or using robust regression algorithms if outliers are a significant concern for your SVM regression model. However, when it comes to choosing an evaluation metric that is robust to outliers, MAE is a reliable choice."

        "\n",
        "Same Units as the Target Variable: RMSE is the square root of MSE, so it has the same units as the target variable. This makes it more interpretable because it directly represents the typical error in the same units as the predictions and actual values. In contrast, MSE is in squared units, which can be less intuitive to interpret.\n",

If you want to ensure that the model is not making significantly large errors, RMSE is a better choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematical Properties: RMSE has some mathematical advantages, such as being more sensitive to the variations in prediction errors compared to MSE. This can be useful for assessing the model's performance in capturing the variability in the target variable.\n",

        "That said, both MSE and RMSE provide similar information about the model's performance, and the choice between them might not significantly impact your understanding of the model's quality. Therefore, if the values of MSE and RMSE are very close, it is reasonable to choose RMSE for its interpretability and the slight additional emphasis on larger errors."
